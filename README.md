# Portfolio-Optimization-via-Metropolis

I will optimize a portfolio of 50 stocks using the Metropolis algorithm. I will consider 3 different scenarios. The first has no constraints, the second considers portfolios with no short positions and the third considers portfolios where each stock has an equal weight in the portfolio.

Unfortunately the original F.h headerfile is unretrievable.

There are 3 cpp files each corresponding to the above scenarios.
There are also screenshots of the optimal portfolios.
